## 📄 Project Overview
This project analyzes historical bike sharing data to predict future demand. It follows the data science pipeline from data understanding to supervised regression and time-series forecasting.

The assignment consists of three main tasks:

1.  **Task 1: Data Description & Visualization** Loading the dataset, cleaning data (handling datetime), and visualizing patterns (seasonality, daily trends).
2.  **Task 2: Demand Prediction (Regression)** Building a Random Forest regression model to predict the number of rented bikes based on weather and calendar conditions ("What-if" analysis).
3.  **Task 3: 30-Day Forecast (Time Series)** Implementing a time-series model using lag features and rolling statistics to forecast demand recursively for the next 30 time steps.
